            Alright, today, we're going to talk about manners. So, manners refer to the way a  person behaves towards other people or in front of other people. So, we'll be talking  about good manners and bad manners in today's episode. Remember that you have the  transcript available for this episode in the Episode Description. So, go down and click on  that if you need it. And please remember to give this podcast a five-star rating if you like  it, and share it with anyone else who might find it useful, and help this podcast grow.  Alright, let's get started.  
            </p>
            <p>
            Okay, so let's talk about manners. As I mentioned, when we talk about manners  in English, we’re talking about the way that a person behaves toward others or in front  of others, things that are considered to be polite or not polite. So, I'll mainly be talking  about good manners in the US, but if I can, I'll try to compare these to manners in other  countries if I know enough to talk about that. But I'll talk mostly about the manners that  are considered to be good or bad in the US. So first, let's talk about table manners. This  is a very good topic because it's different in different countries. And I've experienced  this, having lived abroad, so I know that table manners are not universal. They’re  manners that depend on each individual culture.  
            </p>
            <p>
            So, first, I want to mention that in the US, I feel like table manners are kind of  fading away. In English, when we say the phrase “fade away,” we're saying that  something is disappearing. So, I feel like table manners in the US are fading away. And 
            now, we don't have a very high standard for the things you need to do when you're at  the dinner table. But a couple of generations ago, or maybe just one generation ago,  table manners were still taught, and children still learned what to do and what not to do  at the table. And there was a very clear code, a very clear set of rules that you were  supposed to follow.  
            </p>
            <p>
            And I even remember that when I was in third grade, when I was eight years old.  I learned these table manners at school, actually. We had one or two days in specific  where we actually learned what to do and what not to do at the dinner table, and we  practiced with this, and we had the homework of going home and practicing at home  with our families, too. And I remember doing this. So, that's pretty interesting, because  I'm almost positive that nowadays, in school in the US, children do not learn table  manners. I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure that's the case. I'm pretty sure that this  has faded away and people don't learn this in school nowadays.  
            </p>
            <p>
            So, let's talk a little bit about some good etiquette that isn't taught anymore, but  that I was taught when I was a kid. By the way, “etiquette” just refers to manners or the  certain standards or the code of rules that you have in some area. So, we're going to  talk about good table etiquette. So, let's talk about how we hold our utensils and how we  use our utensils. The word “utensils” refers to forks, spoons, and knives, those things.  So, I'm not an expert on this, so I might not know exactly how to use each one, but I'm  going to speak from my experience of what I think I remember that I learned when I was  a child.  
            </p>
            <p>
            So, for example, when you're cutting meat… let's say you're eating a big steak,  right? You're supposed to cut the meat with the knife in your right hand and then the fork  in your left hand. And then, if I'm not mistaken, you're supposed to put your knife down  after you cut it. And then, you switch hands, and then you eat with your right hand. So,  you put the fork in your right hand and you eat it. I'm not sure if this is what people  always do, and I'm not sure if this is 100% correct, but I've been told by several people  that this is how you're supposed to eat your meat. And I can honestly say that I don't do  this. I just keep my fork in my left hand and my knife in my right hand, and I just eat with  my left hand. So, I'm sure that if I did this in front of someone who really values good  table etiquette, they probably wouldn't be happy with me. But this is what feels easy for  me, so I do it.  
            </p>
            <p>
            And another thing that I do wrong is that I use the wrong spoon when I eat  different when I eat different types of food with a spoon. So, we have this small spoon  and we have a big spoon, in the US at least, and they have different uses. These  spoons are used to eat different things and you're supposed to use the small spoon for  this food but a big spoon for that food. But I always prefer just using the small spoon for  everything. I know this might be a little strange, but I don't like putting this big spoon in  my mouth. I just prefer the smaller one. So, no matter what it is that I'm eating, I always  use this small spoon.  
            </p>
            <p>
            And sometimes, my dad comments on this, and he says “Oh, you brought out the  wrong spoon.” And I say “No, this is the one I prefer to use.” I just use this for  everything. So, as you can see, I don't use my utensils very well. I don't follow the  normal etiquette. I just use them according to my preferences. So, that's one thing that I  don't do, right, so to say. But I'm sure for a lot of you, it doesn't really matter. You  probably don't care too much about how someone uses their utensils either. 
            </p>
            <p>
              So, another thing that you're not supposed to do at the dinner table in the US is  put your elbows on the table. I think this is also the case in a lot of other countries. I'm  not sure exactly, but I remember hearing other people tell me the same thing. So, when  I was a kid, it was still considered bad manners to put your elbows on the table and  keep them there while you're eating.  
            </p>
            <p>
            Nowadays, I feel like everybody does this. I think that everybody puts their  elbows on the table. No one really pays much attention to this, and I don't think people  get offended by this. And I don't know exactly where this comes from, where… this  custom of not putting your elbows on the table… I don't know where that comes from.  And I don't know why it's considered rude to put your elbows on the table. But that was  something that I still heard when I was a kid. But like I said, nowadays, I don't think it's a  big deal.  
            </p>
            <p>
            Another thing that's very important, or at least it used to be very important when I  was a kid… I'm not sure if it still is… but when I was a kid, we would always wait for  everyone to be seated at the table before we started eating. This was really important.  We didn't start eating before other people were at the table. And another thing is we  didn't start eating before the other people were served their food. So, for example, when  I went to restaurants as a kid, if the waiter brought out my food first, I would usually wait  until the other people had their food in front of them, and then we would all start  together. This is something that's different in different countries. I know this for a fact.  
            </p>
            <p>
            Here in Mexico, where I live, I rarely see people wait for everyone else to have  their food before they start. And you can even see this difference in the way that waiters  and waitresses bring out their diners’ food. In English, you can use the word “diner” to  refer to the person who's eating at a restaurant. So, these are the diners.  
            </p>
            <p>
            So, you can see a difference in the way waiters and waitresses bring food to the  diners in restaurants here. Because a lot of times, they bring one person's food, and  then they don't bring the other person's food until like five minutes later. In the US, in  most places, this would not be good. People would be pretty frustrated if this happened.  But in Mexico, it seems to happen quite a bit, in my experience. In English, the phrase  “quite a bit” a lot. Right? So, this happens a lot, this happens quite a bit here in Mexico.  
            </p>
            <p>
            So, I think that different cultures think differently about this custom. In the US, we  always think that you're supposed to wait for other people. It's bad manners to start  eating before the other person has their food. But in Mexico, it's not a big deal. I rarely  have meals with people here where everyone starts eating at the same time, and they're  all sitting at the table together. This is very different here.  
            </p>
            <p>
            And another thing that I wasn't allowed to do when I was a kid was have  electronics at the table and watch TV when I was eating. So, we didn't do any of that  when I was a kid, when I ate meals with my family. But nowadays, you see this  everywhere. People have the TV on in the background. The kids have their cell phones  out or their tablet or whatever. This is really common nowadays.  
            </p>
            <p>
            But when I was a kid, we were supposed to just sit down at the table and talk to  our family members, talk about our day, and not be distracted by these devices. In  English, the word “device” refers to some electronic machine like a cell phone or a  tablet, or whatever, that you interact with. So, we weren't supposed to be distracted with  these devices. We were supposed to pay attention to the other people sitting at the  table. So, that was one other custom that I was taught. 
            </p>
            <p>
            And one other thing in terms of table manners is that a couple generations ago, it  was still very, very normal… it was the standard for kids to ask to be excused before  they left the table. So, if a child finished his food, and he wanted to go up and do his  homework, or something, because he needed to do something else… if everyone else  was still at the table, he would have to ask his parents if he could be excused from the  table. So, he couldn't just leave and go away. He had to ask for permission. So, he  would say, “May I be excused,” for example, and his parents would have to give him  permission and then he could leave. This almost never happens nowadays. I've like  never seen this before. So, I think that this died out couple generations ago. In English,  when we say that something “dies out,” it just means that it goes away. It fades away. It  disappears. It dies out.  
            </p>
            <p>
            Alright, now let's talk about one other big category of manners, which is when  we're talking to other people. So, of course, everyone learns that it's important to say  “please” and “thank you.” This is an example of good manners, when you say “please”  and “thank you” when you're asking for things, when you're talking to people. So, I think  this is standard in pretty much every country, I would guess. But there are other things  that are a little bit different in different countries. For example, in the US, it's important to  be more indirect when you're talking to people. We are not a direct culture in our  communication. We prefer to be indirect, and so, we ask a lot of indirect questions, for  example.  
            </p>
            <p>
            Let's say that you want to know where the bathroom is. You're at a restaurant or  something, and you ask the waiter about the bathroom. We would not say, “Where's the  bathroom?” We would say, “Could you tell me where the bathroom is?” Right? So, we  would ask this more indirect question to sound more polite because in the US, if you ask  very direct questions, it can sound rude, actually.  
            </p>
            <p>
            And I often have to tell my students this because many students of mine say  sentences like this: “Please tell me the answer,” or they'll say, “Please respond when  you can” or something like that. And they think that if they just add the word “please” to  any sentence, then it sounds nice, but in English, it usually sounds rude if you give  someone a command. We don't like to be commanded. We like to be asked indirectly.  So, instead of saying, “Please tell me the answer,” we would say, “Could you tell me the  answer”? We don't even need the word “please” here. It doesn't really do much. You  could say “Could you please tell me the answer”? But the “please” isn't necessary. So,  as you can see, we prefer to be very indirect in the US. This is considered polite and  good manners.  
            </p>
            <p>
            And another thing is that we very frequently use the word “sorry” in English, in  the US, at least. So, we apologize for a lot of things, even if we didn't do anything  wrong. Like, maybe, we just want to ask someone a question. We have to go up to  someone and ask them for some information. We might start our sentence with “Sorry,  could you tell me…” and then ask the question. So, this is something that is considered  to be polite in the US, to apologize a lot, say “sorry,” say “excuse me.” That's another  one that's good. So, we like to use all of these phrases, and we like to sound as indirect  as possible.  
            </p>
            <p>
              Another thing that's considered good manners in the US is to make small talk.  So, this isn't necessarily something that everyone likes, but it's considered good  manners. It's considered polite to make small talk with people and not to just be in 
            silence, for example, or just be really direct with them. It's nice to make a little bit of  small talk, to be friendly to other people. That's something that you can, maybe, practice  with and get better at. Not everyone is good at this, but it's a good skill to have in the  US.  
            And one other thing that I wanted to mention is that in the US, it's very normal to  introduce yourself and introduce other people that you're bringing to some social  situation. And it's important to introduce everyone and get everyone's name and tell  them your name. This is always something that I did growing up. However, in Mexico,  where I live now, I find that it's very common for people to not really introduce  themselves well. So, sometimes if you go to a social event, and you see a lot of other  people there that you don't know, it's very common for you to still not know any of their  names by the end of the event if you don't spend a lot of time talking to them. Right?  
            </p>
            <p>
            But in the US, it's common for people to introduce everyone even if you're not  going to talk to them, even if you're probably not going to say anything else to them  during the event. You still introduce yourself, or you introduce your date who you  brought to the event. This is very important in the US. I think it would be considered a  little bit rude if you didn't make all of these introductions, for example. So, that's an  important thing to know.  
            </p>
            <p>
            And lastly, just a couple things that you're not supposed to talk about with people  or ask about in social situations… is in the US, you’re not supposed to ask people about  their salary. You're not supposed to ask people about how much money they make. I've  actually heard that at least in one other country, in particular, this is actually normal for  people to ask other people about their salaries. So, I don't think this is the case in every  country.  
            
            But at least in the US, this would be considered rude to ask someone how much  money they make. This is usually a secret. It's usually even a secret for the children, at  least when I was growing up. I didn't know how much money my parents made. So, this  is kind of a private thing for a lot of people. I think it might depend on the person of  course, but in general, you probably want to refrain from asking people this question. In  English, the verb “refrain” just means that you don't do something. So, if you refrain from  doing something, you don't do it.  
            </p>
            <p>
            And one other thing that you might not want to ask people is their age. So, this  will depend on how old they are. And it's also different with men and women, but  usually, if you're talking to a woman, it's not polite to ask her her age. For a man, I think  it's more acceptable, but at least for women, it might be more of a secret. So, that's  something that you might not want to do.  
            </p>
            <p>
