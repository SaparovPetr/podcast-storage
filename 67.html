              <p>
                Alright, in today's episode, we're going to talk about something very interesting  for me. I've been reading a book recently. I haven't finished yet, but it's a very interesting  book, and I'd like to talk about it today. The title of the book is The Atoms of Language,  and it's written by Mark Baker. So, I want to talk about this today. I'm going to talk about  some of the main points in this book. This book talks about the structure of human  language and how all the languages of the world are both similar and different at the  same time. It's a really fascinating subject, in my opinion, and I hope that it's interesting  for you as well.  
              </p>
              <p>
                Before we start, remember to give this podcast a five-star rating, and please  share this podcast with anyone else who might find it useful. Also, remember that you  have the transcript available for this episode. That's in the Episode Description. So, go  down and click on that if you need it. Alright, let's get started.  
              </p>
              <p>
                Okay, so let's talk about this book: The Atoms of Language. So, this book talks  mainly about the syntax of language, not the other features of human language. The  syntax refers to the arrangement of words and phrases within a language, so… how we  place our words, where we place them within our sentences. So, of course, there are  some similarities between different languages and differences between different  languages in terms of their syntax, and he explores this topic, and he does so in a very  interesting way. So, he looks at this topic using the idea of parameters.  
              </p>
              <p>
                So, in linguistics, the word “parameters” refers to the features that languages can  have that differentiate their syntax from other languages. Okay? So, these are the  characteristics that make languages either similar or different in the way that they're  constructed. And so, this is a very big theory in the linguistic world. And it's one of the  best theories to explain the differences and similarities between human languages.  
              </p>
              <p>
                So, let me give you one example of a parameter. This is called the null subject  parameter. This parameter states that languages either always need subjects in their  sentences, or they don't always need subjects if they're not necessary. So, all 
              languages—I’m pretty sure—fall into one of these two categories. Either you need  subjects in your sentences, or you sometimes don't need subjects depending on the  type of sentence. Okay?  
              </p>
              <p>
                So, let me give you an example of this. In English, we always need subjects in  our sentences can't. So, even if it doesn't seem like there's a subject, we still need to  put a subject, and in English, we use the word “it” in this case. For example, let's talk  about the weather. When we talk about the weather, there are some interesting  
                sentences that we use in English where we use the word “it” as the subject. For  example, we can say “it's raining,” right? We don't say “the sky is raining” or “the clouds  are raining.” We just say “it's raining.” Okay? This word “it” doesn't really refer to  anything. It's not talking about any real thing. But in English, we can't just say “raining,”  right? We need to say “it's raining.” Or for example, we also say “it's hot” and “it's cold.”  That word “it” doesn't refer to anything in these sentences either. Okay?  
              </p>
              <p>
              However, in a language like Spanish, when we say sentences like this, we don't  actually have a subject. We can just say “está lloviendo.” This means “is raining.”  There’s no “it” there. It's just the verb “is” and “raining.” So, this is very different in  English and in Spanish, because in English, if you say a sentence without a subject, it  sounds completely wrong. However, in Spanish sometimes you don't need a subject.  And there are many sentences like that, where you can use the correct form of the verb  to indicate what subject you're talking about. And in English, you can't do that.  
              </p>
              <p>
              So, this is one example of a parameter, right? Languages fall into one of these  two categories: either they need subjects or they don't need subjects, and depending on  which category they fall into, this will affect a lot of other sentences in that language.  Okay?  
              </p>
              <p>
              One other type of parameter that I want to mention is the word order parameter.  And this parameter is interesting because when we look at word order in all of the  languages that have some type of fixed word order, where the word order is an  essential part of the language, there are really two main types of word order. Right?  There aren't many different types. There are just two main types, and then of course,  there are some minor types as well. But these two main types make up the vast majority  of all the languages in the world. So, these two main types are like 95% of the  languages where word order matters, if I'm not mistaken.  
              </p>
              <p>
              So, for example, one of the main types of word orders is the word order that we  have in English, where we have subject-verb-object. So, for example, John hit the ball,  right? The subject is “John,” “hit” is the verb, and “ball” is the object. And then, we have  another very popular word order type, which is the Japanese type, for example, where  you have subject-object-verb. So, the object usually comes before the verb in these  languages. So, these are the two main types of word order. And like I said, there are a  few other types, but a very small percentage of languages have those types. So, in  general, when we talk about different word orders, we talk about two main types of word  orders.  
              </p>
              <p>
              And this is really surprising. Let me tell you why. If you were to just think about  this topic about how many different types of word order we could have in human  language, people would usually think that there's either one main word order, or that  there are tons of different word orders, many different word orders. Because for  example, some people would say that there's probably just one word order because this 
              is the way that our brain logically thinks. It always thinks about the subject first, and then  the verb, and then the object. So, all languages should follow that natural order, that  logical order of how we think, right? That's one way people might think about this topic if  they were to just guess about how many word orders there are. They might just say one  because “that's the way our brain thinks.”  
              </p>
              <p>
              Or some other people might say that there are many different types of word  orders, and that they're pretty random because languages just have all these different  random features and random orders. And so, there's probably a ton of different word  orders. So, most people would think that it's either one of those two options: either one  word order or many different random word orders.  
              </p>
              <p>
              However, there are two, exactly two main types. Like I said, there are more, but  I'm talking about the main types. And this is really interesting, because why should there  be two main types? Why aren't there three main types or four main types? It's a very  interesting question that the author explores in this book. And it shows that there are  certain restrictions or limitations in the human brain when it comes to language.  Language is not completely random, like many people might think. There are actually  rules that are just naturally there when it comes to language. And the author explores  this in detail with some of the other parameters that he talks about.  
              </p>
              <p>
              But the main point that I take away from this, this idea that languages aren't just  random, they have a set of rules, and some languages choose one option and some  languages choose the other option of the parameter… this is all part of the theory of  universal grammar. This theory states that there are certain innate constraints on what a  language can be. In English, the word “innate” refers to something natural, something  that is already there. For example, I could say “He has an innate ability to teach.” I'm  saying that he was born with that ability. It's a natural ability. So, in universal grammar,  we have the idea that there are innate constraints or restrictions on what a language  could be. We can't just have a language with all these really random features in it. There  are really only a few choices that the language can “make,” so to say.  
              </p>
              <p>
              So, for example, there are almost zero languages in the world that have the word  order: object-subject-verb. If languages were just randomly constructed, then we  wouldn't expect to see this type of phenomenon. We would expect there to be some  languages that are subject-verb-object, some that are subject-object-verb, some that  are object-verb-subject, some that are objects-subject-verb, etc. And we would expect  these to be relatively equal in number, right? We wouldn't expect there to just be two  main types of word order. And we definitely wouldn't expect there to be zero or almost  zero languages that have the object-subject-verb word order. It really doesn't make  sense.  
              </p>
              <p>
              Why don't languages have that word order? There are thousands of languages in  the world, and almost zero of them have this word order. It doesn't really make sense if  we think that languages are just randomly constructed. So, this is the idea of universal  grammar, that there are already certain rules and restrictions in the human brain that  limit the types of languages we can create in our world.  
              </p>
              <p>
                So, this is a really fascinating idea. And I would recommend that you read more  about this. If you think this is interesting, you can look up articles on universal grammar  or read books about this. And what's also interesting about this is that the idea of  universal grammar is that language isn't completely determined by our history and our 
                culture and things like that. And this is what most people would assume. They would  assume that because of our history and our culture, languages develop in certain ways.  Of course, words can be developed in this way, and certain parts of the language can,  but in terms of the syntax, the way that we order the words in our sentences, it's not  really determined by these factors.  
              </p>
              <p>
              So, for example, we see neighbor cultures, cultures that are right next to each  other geographically, in the same region, that have completely different types of  languages. They have completely different grammar and syntax even though these  cultures have lived next to each other for centuries, for example. And yet, we have  some cultures that are very far from each other, that are in different parts of the world,  and they have the same language structure or very similar language structures, even  though these cultures have had no contact and no influence on each other.  
              </p>
              <p>
              So, we can see that this aspect of language isn't determined by the history or the  culture of the people who are speaking it. It's determined by this idea of universal  grammar, that languages can either be this way or that way. And some languages  choose to be this way, and some languages choose to be that way. Some languages  are more like English and their word order, and some languages are more like  Japanese in their word order. And this is the vast majority of languages. There aren't  just many, many different types of word order among the languages of the world. It's not  like that. So, this is the idea of universal grammar. So, some of you might disagree with  this, or some of you might not know much about this, but I encourage you to, like I said,  read more about this and think about this because it's a very interesting idea to  consider.  
              </p>
              <p>
              So, lastly, I just want to talk a little bit about language acquisition and what these  ideas have to do with the way we acquire language. So, when we think of how children  and adults acquire language, we can see that children definitely have an advantage. I'm  sure you've seen this before. If an adult and their child move to a new country, usually,  the child learns that language very fast and the adult doesn't. This is a very common  scenario. So, why does a child have such a head start when it comes to acquiring a new  language? In English, the word “head start” refers to when one person gets an  advantage, and they get to start early or do something early before the other competitor,  for example. So, children have a head start when it comes to acquiring languages, it  seems.  
              </p>
              <p>
              So, one idea is that children are exposed to a rule or a couple of rules when  they're just listening to the new language, and they have this ability to deduce or infer  other rules from that first rule. Right? So, for example, if they hear the sentence, “It's  raining,” after a while, they can understand that in this language, subjects are  necessary, right? The fact that the word “it” is there means that subjects are necessary.  And this is not something that consciously think, and it's not something we analyze  when we're listening to native speakers talk, but it's something that's in the child's brain,  and it helps them understand other rules of the language. So, if they see in this  sentence, that the person is saying “it,” but they're not referring to anything, then the  child's brain starts to understand that this is a feature of the language, that the language  needs a subject even if there's no real subject.  
              </p>
              <p>
              And so, the child starts to understand these rules without even realizing it. And  this is something that children have the ability to do that adults can't really do well. We 
                know this: that adults are not as good as children in seeing these patterns and  understanding them. So, because children have this ability, they're able to acquire  languages much more easily. And so, because of universal grammar, because  languages aren't just randomly constructed, but they have a very solid base or a stable  framework, so to say, children can very easily detect these patterns and start to  understand them more. So, it's something that's already in their brain.  
              </p>
              <p>
              It's like this: we’re born with a certain way of speaking language. Regardless of  what language we speak, our brain is made to construct language in a certain way,  right? There are certain things that we just need to do, we need to construct, when  we're speaking a language. And there are certain things that are off limits. There are  certain combinations or options that we simply can't choose when we're creating a  language. And so, because of these limitations, these natural constraints, children can  easily use this part of their brain to recognize patterns.  
              </p>
              <p>
              So, in summary, language is so incredibly different from other subjects that we  learn. And so, we shouldn't learn languages they way we learn other subjects like math  or physics, for example. This is my opinion. I don't think that we should approach  language like we approach other topics because it works so differently in our brain. I  think we should pay more attention to this idea of universal grammar and parameters,  and we should think differently about how humans acquire language.  
              </p>
