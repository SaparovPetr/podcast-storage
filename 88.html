This is a good topic because I think all of us have eaten fast food or maybe we have the habit of eating fast food on a regular basis. So, I'll talk a little bit about that today and about different things related to that topic.  </p><p>	And remember that you have the transcript available for this episode.

Alright, let's get started. </p><p>	Okay, let's talk about fast food. So, first of all, I want to talk about the difference between fast food and junk food, because many of my students confuse these two phrases, these two terms, and they use the word “junk food” when they really want to say “fast food.” So, “fast food” refers to these restaurants like McDonald's or Burger King or places like that, where you can go in, get your food really fast… it's not really a sit-down restaurant. You can sit down in there, but they don't serve you with waiters or waitresses or anything like that. You just order at the counter, and then they give you your food and then you take it to your table.  </p><p>	In English, when we use the word “counter” in this context, we're talking about the place where you order your food or you buy something, where you pay for it. So, the cashier is usually at the counter. That's where the cash register is. So, that's where you pay and they give you your food or your item, whatever it is that you bought. So, in fast food establishments, you pay at the counter, and then they call your name or your number, and you come get your food, and then you can either take that to go or you can eat that there.  </p><p>	In English, when we use the phrase “to go” in this context, we're talking about ordering food and then taking that to your home… not eating at the restaurant. We say “I'm ordering that to go.” So, you can either order something for here or to go. If you travel to the US, these are the two phrases you'll hear a lot at any type of restaurant, especially a fast food place. They'll say, "Would you like that for here or to go”? Okay? So, a lot of people eat fast food at the restaurant, and a lot of people also order it to go. It just depends on people's preferences. So, this is fast food. That's what I'm referring to when I say “fast food.”  </p><p>	Junk food, on the other hand… this is food that isn't good for you, any food. And usually, we use this term to refer to processed food that you might buy from the store, like a bag of chips, for example, or a chocolate bar, or something like this. Junk food is just any food that isn't good for you. So, it's not referring to McDonald's or Burger King and those places. It could possibly be referring to those depending on the context, but it's a general term for every food that isn't good for you, and we use it especially for processed foods, right? Whereas fast food is specifically used to talk about these types of restaurants. Okay?  </p><p>	So, let's talk about the pros and cons of fast food. So, the first big pro, the first benefit of fast food is that it's very easy to get, right? It's very simple. You can go in, order very fast, and be out of there very quickly with a full meal. And you can also use the drive thru. In English, this phrase refers to the part of a fast food restaurant where you stay in your car, and you order from your car and drive up to the window and pay, and they give you your food. So, that's called the drive thru. So, that's obviously very easy. You don't even need to get out of your car if you don't want to. So, it's very easy to order fast food and to pay for it and take it home. It's a very fast and easy process. </p><p>So, that's a good thing.  </p><p>	And it's usually fairly cheap, especially compared to other sit-down restaurants. So, this is more accessible than just a normal restaurant, and so, more people can afford it. So, that's another good thing. And it's also tasty. People really like fast food. It can be very addictive because the flavoring is very good, usually. So, a lot of people just really like fast food. So, that could be another good thing about it depending on how you look at it.  </p><p>	However, there are a lot of cons to eating fast food, of course, and primarily, the actual nutrients that you're eating. So, fast food usually has low-quality ingredients. That's maybe the biggest problem, right? I'm not saying that every ingredient that's used at every fast food restaurant is bad. I'm not saying that. But I think a lot of the ingredients that they use are a lower quality than ingredients that might be used at another restaurant or ingredients that you might want to buy from the grocery store, for example.  </p><p>	So, the problem isn't that they use chicken. The problem is that they use really poor quality chicken, chicken that you wouldn't normally want to buy if you had the choice, right? Or the problem isn't that they use beef. It’s that they use poor quality beef, and who knows what's in that beef? What they were feeding those cows, what type of hormones or antibiotics are in there? You don't know that. And so, that's probably the biggest issue with fast food, is that the quality of the ingredients are suspect. In English, when we say that something is “suspect,” we're saying that it's a little suspicious, right? We can't trust it completely. So, that's a big con.  </p><p>	And in general, there are a lot of unhealthy options at fast food restaurants. Right? So, not all their food is healthy, obviously. So, aside from just the quality of the ingredients, the actual meals themselves are not the most beneficial for your health. Right? And of course, these meals are very calorie-rich. So, in just one meal, you're probably consuming tons of calories. So, for people that have trouble with their weight, for example, if they eat one combo at one of these restaurants, it's probably going to make them gain weight, and it will probably be not very beneficial overall for their health. So, the cons are about the actual nutrients and the ingredients themselves.  	So, let's talk about who eats fast food in the US. So, a lot of people eat fast food </p><p>on a regular basis, or they go there once in a while, or maybe just for special occasions… not really special occasions, but if they're in a hurry and they have nothing to eat, and they just need to pick something up really fast, they’re in a difficult situation or they're in a hurry or something, then they might pick up fast food. So, it's not part of their normal routine, but they don't have any other choice.  </p><p>	So, a lot of people eat fast food in the US, though, on a regular basis. Some people really try to stay away from fast food. People that tend to take more care of their health might not want to go to fast food restaurants. And I'm not saying that everyone who eats fast food on a regular basis is unhealthy. I don't want to say that here, but what I'm saying is a lot of people that are very health conscious, they don't like fast food. So, you probably know people like this in your country, wherever you're from. So, it tends to be like that. The more health conscious you are, the less you like fast food, but even health conscious people also eat fast food sometimes. That’s a normal thing for people.  </p><p>	So, in the US, unfortunately, a lot of the poorer people, they view fast food as the best option because it's cheap. It's easy. It's accessible for them. So, unfortunately, a lot of people that are in the lower class, they view this as something that they can afford, and it's maybe their only option. Right? That's obviously not true for most people. They could find, maybe, cheaper options at the grocery store. But at these fast food establishments, they get a whole meal prepared for them, the whole combo with all the tasty food, and it doesn't require any effort. So, it seems like the cheapest way to get a meal prepared for you that tastes good. Right?  </p><p>	So, because that's the idea that is prevalent in the US, a lot of poor people will go eat fast food on a regular basis. I've known people that eat fast food every single day in the US. I'm not exaggerating. So, this is, unfortunately, a habit that a lot of people have. But even people that are middle class, or have money, even they might eat fast food on a regular basis. So, I don't want to pick on the lower class here. 	In English, when we say that you "pick on" someone, we're saying that you be mean to someone or criticize someone. I definitely don't want to pick on the lower class. They have this legitimate concern about their finances, and fast food is a good option for their finances. So, don't get me wrong. I don't want to criticize the lower class of people. I just want to talk about how unfortunate it is that we have this lowquality food that so many people consume on a regular basis.  </p><p>	And like I said, it's not just the lower class. The middle class also consumes a lot of fast food. You'll see people that have money, but instead of going to a healthier place or preparing their own food, they also go to fast food restaurants. And this is really common for high schoolers or younger people, for example. They might not think so much about their health, and even though their parents have money, they still want to just go to the fast food restaurant because they like it, right? So, a lot of people eat fast food in the US. This is a very normal thing.  </p><p>	And in other countries, of course, fast food is common as well. I've talked to many students of mine in different parts of the world that really like fast food. They think it tastes great, or they really love going to McDonald's in their country. And I know that the same fast food restaurants have food that tastes different in different countries. So, a hamburger from McDonald's might taste different in the US and in Spain, for example. So, I thought that was pretty interesting to try fast food for the first time abroad when I ate it in Mexico, and then also when I ate it in Spain as well. I could taste some difference in the fast food. It's pretty interesting.  </p><p>	And let me talk a little bit about my experience with fast food. When I was really young, I didn't eat fast food. My mom did not want us to eat fast food. I don't even remember having a normal hamburger for years when I was young. I think I discovered it a little bit later than other kids. I'm not saying that hamburgers in general are fast food. Definitely not. But I'm just saying that, in general, I didn't even try my first hamburger until after you know the normal time when other kids were already eating hamburgers.  </p><p>	So, I didn't know much about fast food when I was a young child. But then, eventually, we started to eat a little bit of fast food… not very often, but we would go there once in a while. And when I ate the most fast food in my life was when I was in high school. Like I mentioned before, this is a very common thing in the US, where high schoolers will go to a nearby fast food establishment after school.  </p><p>	And this is what I did almost every single day after school, a group of people would go to one of the few different fast food establishments that were right near the high school. And so, I didn't eat this every day, but every day there were people that I knew, friends of mind, that went to one of these places. So, I had this option. I could always go with one of these people or with a group of people to go eat fast food. And many other high schoolers do the same thing.  </p><p>	So, that's when I ate the most fast food. I probably ate it every week, because so many of my friends went there on a very regular basis. So, I ate a lot of that type of food when I was in high school. So, obviously that wasn't very good for me.  	But as an adult, I stopped eating fast food very often. I ate it once in a while. And a lot of adults, even if they have money, even if they have other options. they still like eating fast food because it tastes good. A lot of people have a craving for a certain fast food item from a certain restaurant, right? In English, when we say that you have a “craving,” we’re saying that you have a very strong desire for something in this moment. So, a lot of people have that craving as an adult. Even if they know they should eat somewhere else, they still eat fast food.  </p><p>	But as an adult, I haven't eaten much fast food. I go once in a while, but I don't really have those cravings, to be honest. For me, it doesn't seem like something that I need to have in this moment. So, I think that's good because I don't have this addiction, but many other people do have this addiction. So, that's a very common thing. But nowadays, I eat fast food once in a while when we don't have a choice or we need something fast. Then, I'll get it. If I'm not in that situation, then I don't usually eat this.  </p><p>	And what is my favorite fast food? My favorite fast food restaurant is In-N-Out. You might have heard of this before. It's really popular in California. And a lot of people really like this fast food restaurant because their ingredients are fresh. They're actually good quality. I know this because my sister used to work there. So, I was able to see that their ingredients were of a better quality than other fast food restaurants. So, it wasn't quite as unhealthy, and I think it tastes better. It doesn't feel as bad to eat. You don't feel as guilty afterwards.  </p><p>	So, I like In-N-Out. I really like their food. So, that's my favorite place. And I also like to go to McDonald's for their ice cream. And their shakes. I used to drink those when I was younger. So, for dessert, maybe McDonald's, but for the food, In-N-Out is definitely the best quality of fast food, in my opinion. </p><p>	Alright, well, why don't we stop there for today?
