        Alright, in today's episode, I'm going to talk about some different islands that I've been to. First, I want to point out the pronunciation of this word. Notice that the “s” is silent. So we say "…” There’s no “s” sound. Okay? So, I'm going to talk about some different islands that I've been to… just a few of them. I haven't been to many. And so, I'll talk about each one and about my experience there. And hopefully, that will be interesting for you.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember that you have the transcript available. That’s also in the Description below this episode. So, go down and click on that if you need it. And listen to this episode as many times as you need until you can eventually understand everything that I'm saying without using the transcript. And if you like this podcast, please give it a five-star rating and write a review, and share it with anyone else you know who's learning English to help this podcast grow. Alright, let's get started.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Okay, so let's talk about some different islands that I've been to in my life. So, I'm going to start with the Bahamas. This was the island… I'm using “Island” in the singular here because I only went to one of the islands of the Bahamas… so this island was the one that I explored the least. So, we were only there for a couple nights, if I remember correctly.  
      </p>
      <p>
      </p>
      <p>
        And we got there via cruise ship. So, we went to Florida…my family and I… and we took a small cruise ship from Florida to the Bahamas. The Bahamas are very close to Florida, so it doesn't take a long time to get there if you take a cruise. In fact, it's so close that in order to give us more time on the cruise ship, they actually just stopped in the middle of the water and didn't move for many hours just so that we could get a whole night on the cruise ship before arriving at the Bahamas.  
      </p>
      <p>
        So, it's very close to Florida. And these islands are very easy to access. They're great for tourism. And there are a lot of things to do on these islands. However, because I was with my parents and the whole trip was already planned, and I didn't get to decide what we were going to do, I had to just follow their plan, follow their itinerary. So we didn't really do too much when we were there. We stayed at a nice resort, which was cool, but that's not really my thing. In English, we can use the phrase, “that's not my thing” if we're saying that something isn't very interesting for you, or it's not your style. So, if I say, “that’s just not my thing,” I'm saying that's not my style. That's not my interest. That's not what I would normally choose to do.  
      </p>
      <p>
        So, we stayed at a nice resort, but that wasn't really my thing. I prefer to explore and go places and see interesting things. But of course, a lot of people go to the Bahamas just to relax… and for good reason, because they have amazing beaches with really white sand. That's one of the things that I remember the most from this trip was that the sand was so white. And so, during the afternoon, when the sun was high in the sky, the ground, the sand, was so bright that it hurt my eyes. I couldn't even open my eyes on the beach. I had to go back and get sunglasses because of how bright it was.  
      </p>
      <p>
        So, that should give you an idea of how amazing the beach looks there with its white sand and the blue water of course. It’s a great place to relax. It's a great place to just hang out and take it easy and not do much. In English, when we say “take it easy," we're saying that you relax and that you don't do too much. You take it easy. So, a lot of people just go there to take it easy and just enjoy the nice weather and the white sand. So, that's what we did.  
      </p>
      <p>
        However, there was one other things that I do remember that we also did that was a little different which was we went to a street festival. There was a parade actually, and I can't remember why they had that parade. But I think it was something to do with the island, itself. Maybe some historical event or something. I'm not sure. 
      </p>
      <p>
      But it was a huge event. It was like a huge party.  
      </p>
      <p>
        So many people were there, and the parade was very extravagant. It was really interesting. In English, when we say that something is “extravagant,” that means that it is very amazing. It looks really incredible and nice and a lot of money was spent on it. In that case, we can say that something is extravagant. So, this parade was extravagant. The costumes that people wore, were incredible. And I think it lasted for a really long time because I remember that we just decided to leave early because it was already so late at night. So, I assume that the local people there love to party and have these big festivals and events that last for many hours. So, that was the thing I remember the most from that trip.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Okay, so the next set of islands that I want to talk about is the Florida Keys. So, the Florida Keys are part of the United States. And these are small islands off the coast of Florida… the south of the state. So, if you drive to the very south of Florida, you can drive to these keys over the water and drive all the way down to the very last key, or island.  
      </p>
      <p>
        So, the big key at the top is called Key Largo. And you can drive all the way down to Key West, which is the end of the Florida Keys. And this is a pretty unique place because you're actually driving over the water, over the ocean, or I guess it would be the Gulf of Mexico, I think. But you're driving over the water, just on this, like, highway. And it's a pretty unique experience to drive over islands instead of fly to them or take a boat to them. So, that was really cool to drive over the water and drive through these little islands.  
      </p>
      <p>
        And of course, this is a touristic place, but you can see the local life very easily when you drive through the keys. You can see the local establishments and you can see, just, the local people and how people live there. It's really cool. It was an experience that was different from my experience in the Bahamas because we didn't stay in a luxurious resort or anything like that. We just drove through the keys, stayed somewhere… I think we were in Key West, if I'm not mistaken, and we did some local things. We went to the movie theater, we went to local restaurants and then, we drove back. And so, it was a more local experience than our experience in the Bahamas.  	And one thing that we did when we were there that was a highlight of that trip… in English, when we say that something is a “highlight” of something else, we’re saying that it was one of the most significant things from that trip, or whatever. So, one of the highlights of that trip was going parasailing. I think I might have talked about this before in another episode. We went parasailing… I think my mom my sister and I… yeah, we went parasailing together, us three.  
      </p>
      <p>
        And what this is, is they tie you to the end of a boat, to the back of a boat, and you have a parachute above your head, and you're sitting down on this seat with the rope attached to you and the parachute over your head and the boat starts going, and then it tows you behind it. In English, when we say that you “tow” something, we’re saying that you pull something behind you. So, if your car has problems and isn't working, you need to call a tow truck, a truck that will tow you to a mechanic, for example.  
      </p>
      <p>
        So they towed us on the back of this boat, and of course, we were flying high in the sky with the parachute over us. And it was a scary experience. It was very exhilarating, but it was very fun. In English, when we say that something is “exhilarating,” this means that it's really exciting and thrilling, and it's a little bit extreme, maybe, in the way that it makes you feel. So, that was an exhilarating experience, but it was very fun, and I'll always remember it. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Okay, the next island that I want to talk about is Cozumel. I'm saying this with a more American accent, of course. This is an island in Mexico off the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula. It’s right across from the city of Playa Del Carmen. And so first, we went to Playa Del Carmen, and then we took a boat across a little stretch of water, and we went to Cozumel. And so, this is not a very big island, but it's a little bit bigger than, maybe, some of the Florida Keys that I went to, some of those little islands. But this is a cool place to spend, maybe, one day or even just one afternoon.  
      </p>
      <p>
        So, what we did when we were on this island was we rented electric scooters, and we rode around about half of the island on these electric scooters. This was my first time driving one of these vehicles. So, it was a little bit scary for me at first, especially because I had my wife with me on the back of the scooter. And so, I wasn't just responsible for my life. I was responsible for hers too. And we drove on the normal street that went around the island. So, there were cars around us. That's why it was a little bit scary, I would say.  
      </p>
      <p>
        But I realized that it's not that hard to drive these scooters. You can get the hang of it pretty easily. In English, when we say that you “get the hang of” something, we’re saying that you get accustomed to something or get accustomed to using something so that it becomes more comfortable for you. So, you can get the hang of this electric scooter pretty easily, even if you've never driven on one before.  
      </p>
      <p>
        And so, we went around like half the island, and this was a really cool feeling to be riding a scooter in the sunshine with the wind blowing in our faces. This was an experience that a lot of people seek when they buy a motorcycle, and they want to take road trips on the coast, for example. It was that type of feeling… of driving in the open air with coast right beside us so we could see the ocean, and the wind was blowing in our faces, like I mentioned, and it was a really unique feeling.  
      </p>
      <p>
        So, I really liked that, and that was the first and only time I've done something like that. I don't like motorcycles. I don't like those types of vehicles. So, it wouldn't be my first choice to rent something like that, but my dad really wanted to, so that's why we did it. But I'm glad we did because I'll always remember that experience. So, that was really cool to ride those scooters around the island.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Okay, one other island that I want to talk about is Hawaii. So, this is an island, or a set of islands, because there are multiple islands, four main islands and some other minor islands. This is a set of islands that I know fairly well because I've been to Hawaii many times, actually. I've had the privilege to go there multiple times to multiple islands with my family. And I enjoyed every single trip that I took there.  
      </p>
      <p>
        So, Hawaii is a state. It's one of the United States, one of our 50 states, but of course, it's an island, so it's far from the rest of the country. It's in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. But it's a place that a lot of Americans love to travel to. It's a great tourist destination because it's a tropical paradise. It's tropical, so it's always warm. It doesn't matter if you go in the winter or the summer. It's always warm. It rains a lot because it's very tropical. And it's very beautiful in terms of its nature. It has forest all around. It's very green. It's very beautiful in that sense.  
      </p>
      <p>
        And Hawaii consists of different volcanoes. So, this is a set of volcanic islands. I remember that some years ago, there was a lot of lava coming from one of the volcanoes, and that can, of course, ruin a lot of things and damage a lot of places. And so, that can be hard for the people that live there and it can be a deterrent to tourists, of course. In English, when we say that something is a “deterrent” or something “deters” something else, we’re saying that it causes other things or other people to not want to go there or not want to do that. So, it's a deterrent when people hear that 
      </p>
      <p>
      Hawaii is a volcano, and there's lava, and stuff like that.  
      </p>
      <p>
        However, it's a great place to go to. It has many pristine beaches. In English, the word “pristine” means that something is untouched. It’s like perfect, in its original form. So, there are a lot of pristine beaches. And there are a lot of hidden beaches, local beaches that tourists wouldn't normally be able to find. And there are just so many places to enjoy, so many beaches to enjoy.  
      </p>
      <p>
        And so, I've been many times as I mentioned, and I like all of the islands that I've been to. However, I have some family members on the Big Island. The Big Island is, of course, the biggest of the islands. And my family members… they’re not my first cousins, but they're my second cousins… they have a house on the Big Island, and it's in a place that's very local. So, when I visited them, it wasn't like being a tourist. It was like being in the local town, seeing the local life around me, and they took me to places that tourists have probably never been to before. So, that was really special. I really enjoyed that type of experience when I was there.  
      </p>
      <p>
        However, I also enjoyed the opposite type of experience when I went to Hawaii when I was 13. I went with a friend of mine, and we went to Honolulu. This is the capital of Hawaii. It's the only big city in Hawaii. So, that was the opposite experience. It was very touristic. They were tourists everywhere. But the city was very nice. The beaches there were also really cool even though they were more crowded. But that was cool to see… kind of the big city life but on an island. Right? That was something pretty unique, I think. So, Hawaii, as I mentioned, is part of the US. So, it's a US state just like any other state.  
      </p>
      <p>
        However, you can see that it's very different in terms of its lifestyle, in terms of how people live their lives, how they think, how they act, how they interact with each other. It's a very different place. Sometimes, it doesn't seem like it's just another state of the United States. So, that's a really cool thing that makes it different from the other states. It has an island lifestyle, a different feel to it. So, those are the different islands that I've been to. I hope to go to more in the future, and I'm sure I will, but those are the ones that I've had the chance to go to so far.
