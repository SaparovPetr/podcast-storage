            <p>Transcript: “Listening Time” Episode 69 

            </p>

And please give this podcast a five-star rating if you like it,  which will help this podcast grow. Alright, let's get started.  
            </p>
            <p>
            Okay, let's talk about my trip to Nuevo Vallarta. So, first of all, let me explain  where Nuevo Vallarta is. It's in the state of Nayarit. It's in the very south of the state,  here in Mexico, and it's right on the Pacific Ocean. And it's very close to a more well known city called Puerto Vallarta. You might have already heard of this city before. This  is a major tourist destination here in Mexico. But Nuevo Vallarta is also a big tourist  place. It's just not quite as popular as Puerto Vallarta.  
            </p>
            <p>
            So, Nuevo Vallarta is much smaller, and it's mostly a lot of hotels and resorts,  whereas Puerto Vallarta has an actual city with a downtown and all of that. I've already  been to Puerto Vallarta a couple of times. So, this time, we went to Nuevo Vallarta,  which is a new place for me. So, we stayed in a resort, which is not normal for me  because I normally can't afford to stay in a resort. In English, when we say you “can't  afford” something, this means that you don't have enough money to buy something. So,  if I say “I can't afford a new car right now,” I'm saying that I don't have enough money to  buy a new car.  
            </p>
            <p>
            So, normally I don't stay in resorts because I can't afford it. But this time my aunt  gave me this week at this resort as a gift. So, I actually didn't pay anything for the resort.  So, that's the reason why we stayed there. Normally, we would stay in a cheap Airbnb,  and that's more of my style of traveling. But this time, we got this gift to stay in a nice  resort, so we decided to enjoy ourselves there and enjoy this more luxurious style of 
            travel. However, one thing that I don't really like about staying in resorts is that all of the  food, the restaurants there, everything is really expensive.  
            </p>
            <p>
            So, even though I stayed for free at this resort, it didn't feel that comfortable for  me to stay there all day because if we wanted to buy food, it was definitely expensive.  All of the restaurants are pretty nice, and it's a little bit out of my price range. In English,  when we say that something is “out of your price range,” this just means that it's a little  too expensive for you. So, if you guys have ever stayed in resorts before, you know  what I'm talking about, everything is more expensive than in other places. So…  
            </p>
            <p>
            Alright, well, let's talk a little bit about my road trip to Nuevo Vallarta. So, we  actually had to drive about five hours to get there. At the beginning of the episode, I  mentioned that Nuevo Vallarta isn't that far. And you're probably wondering, “How is that  possible? You had to drive five hours to get there. That seems pretty far.” Well,  geographically, Nuevo Vallarta isn't very far from where I live, here in my city. However,  there's no highway that goes directly in a straight line to the coast. So, it's a lot of windy  roads that go up and down and north and south, and it takes a long time to get there. In  English, when we say the phrase “windy roads,” we’re talking about roads that go left  and right, and up and down. They're not straight. They look like a snake, kind of. So,  these are windy roads. So, that's why I said that Nuevo Vallarta is not very far  geographically, but it takes a long time to drive there.  
            </p>
            <p>
            So, the road trip to go there is beautiful. It's a fantastic road trip. Everything from  my city until Nuevo Vallarta is nice and green and beautiful, especially right now,  because we're at the end of the rainy season here, and so, it's been raining a lot the last  three months, and so, everything is green and lush and beautiful. When we say that  something is “lush” in English, we mean that there's a lot of green nature and plants and  things like that. So, it's beautiful and lush right now.  
            </p>
            <p>
            So, it's a really enjoyable road trip even though you have to drive a lot of hours.  You really enjoy it because you get to really take in the scenery and enjoy the views. In  English, when we say that you “take in” some view or scenery, it just means that you  look at it and admire it and enjoy it. So, it was nice to drive there, and I was able to take  in all of this beautiful scenery. So, I really liked that, especially closer to the coast  because it becomes a little more jungly. It's kind of like a tropical forest. I don't know if  that forest is actually classified as a tropical forest or not, but it looks more tropical and  it's very dense. And there are really cool looking trees and plants everywhere. And there  are, like, tunnels of trees where the trees are overhead. They're over you, and they  create kind of a tunnel that you drive through. So, I really liked the road trip there. So,  that part was really fun.  
            </p>
            <p>
              The part that I didn't like about the road trip is that you have to pay tolls. In  English, a “toll” is an amount of money that you have to pay to drive on some road. So,  as I've mentioned before in other episodes where I talked about road trips, in Mexico, if  
            you want to take the good highways, then you have to pay tolls, and you have to pay a  lot of them. So, I think during my road trip, we paid like four or five tolls. So, that's very  normal in Mexico. If you're going to drive five hours, you're probably going to pay five  tolls. So, I don't like that part because it costs more money. And I don't like that some of  the roads are not very well-maintained. And so, you have to be very careful because  there are holes, and other things like that, that you need to avoid as you're driving. So, 
              there are some things like that that make it a little bit hard. But overall, like I mentioned,  it's a fun road trip, so I can't complain.  
            </p>
            <p>
            Let me talk about the weather in Nuevo Vallarta. So, this is a negative point for  some people, because it's very hot and humid. And when you walk outside, you're  immediately hit by this heat and this heaviness in the air. It's very humid, and so you  sweat all day when you're outside. I was sweating constantly when I was there. I was  always wet because of this, because it just feels so tropical, so hot and humid. And so,  a lot of people, they just want to go inside and turn on the AC and just cool down. In  English, when we say AC, we're referring to air conditioning. So, every building in Nuevo  Vallarta has air conditioning. And so, when you walk inside some building, or you go  inside the hotel, it's really cold compared to outside.  
            </p>
            <p>
            So, I don't really like this type of heat. As you might know by now, I really like  sunny weather and I like hot weather, but I prefer dry heat. I prefer more desert-like  weather. So, for me, I like the hot weather in places on the coast, but I don't really like  how humid it is. It's not very comfortable. But I don't complain because I prefer the sun  rather than the rain or cloudy days. It rained a little bit when we were there. I think it  rained on two of the days, maybe. But it was in the evening, and we still got many hours  of sunlight, so it wasn't bad.  
            </p>
            <p>
            Let me talk a little bit more about the resort now. So, we stayed in a very beautiful  room. I really appreciated the room that my aunt got us because it had a really big  balcony overlooking the pool area and the ocean. And there was a bathtub inside the  bedroom and there were nice showers and everything was nice and clean, and it felt  really cool to be in there. So, I really appreciated that. It was a great room to stay in.  The pool was fantastic too. It was really nice to be able to take my one-year-old son into  the water because he loves the pool. So, he spent hours and hours in the water. And it  was really fun to just watch him be happy and play with his toys in the water. And it was  really cool. So, that was great for him and for us too. We really enjoyed being in the pool  for many hours with him.  
            </p>
            <p>
            I'm not a big pool person. I grew up with a swimming pool, actually. But I never  really swam that much when I was younger. I'm not a water person in general, but it was  nice to spend a lot of time in the pool during this vacation because it was relaxing and  because my son had so much fun. So, even though I'm not a big pool person, it was still  really cool to spend a lot of time in the pool this last week. So, the pool was great. And if  you stay at a resort like this, you have access to the beach directly from the resort,  which is cool. So, if you walk through the pool area, you can go down to the beach, and  it's kind of like your own private beach. Of course, there are other people that can  access the beach if they just walk on the sand from some other point. But it feels like  there aren't a lot of people there and it's just the people at the hotel. So, that was cool.  
            </p>
            <p>
            But during this week, I think there was a hurricane in some other place on the  coast of Mexico, and this kind of affected the waves in the ocean where we were. And  so, there were some days… I think two days or maybe three days where it was a little  bit rough in the water. When I use the word “rough” like this, I'm saying that it was a little  bit extreme. It was not very calm. So, there were some huge waves, and it was a little  bit dangerous. And so, on those days, I didn't go in the water. But on the other days, it  was really nice. And there were always a lot of waves when we were there. 
            </p>
            <p>
            And I really like waves. I prefer going in the ocean when there are waves. It's  cool to go in the ocean when it's really calm and clear as well, but honestly I prefer  playing in the waves a little bit. I like to go over the waves and go under them and swim  with them. So, I had a lot of fun actually. But a lot of other people didn't want to go in the  water because there were too many waves for them. So, it was great for me but not so  great for some of the other people. But I had a great time at the beach going in the  water.  
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm not a beach person. I don't usually like to spend a lot of time lying on the sand  under the sun. I don't really like all of that, but I really like going in the ocean down here  in Mexico because it's very warm. The water is awesome. It's like being in a bathtub.  So, I really like being in the water. But I don't like spending time on the sand at the  beach. So, I usually just go in the water and then come back out and dry off and leave.  
            </p>
            <p>
            And of course, we ate at some of the restaurants at the resort, but as I  mentioned, they're pretty expensive, and so we tried to eat outside of the resort at some  other places on many of the days. But it was cool to get a little taste of this luxurious  vacationing, right, staying in a resort, ordering room service, things like that. It was cool  to do that. But as I mentioned, it's not my style of travel. So, I would only do this type of  trip if someone gives it to me as a present. So, I think that I won't do another trip like this  for a while, probably.  
            </p>
            <p>
            And now, I want to mention one of the other towns that we drove to… one of the  days that we were staying in Nuevo Vallarta, and it's called Sayulita. And this is a magic  town in Mexico. A magic town is a town that has been designated as being important for  tourism or culture by the Mexican government. And so, these towns are a little bit nicer  and well-maintained than other towns in the country. So, Sayulita is a cool magic town  on the coast of Mexico, and it's especially famous because it's a great place to surf. So,  it has a lot of great waves for surfers.  
            </p>
            <p>
            And so, people that love surfing, they love this town. And we went there one of  the days that we were staying in Nuevo Vallarta, and we watched these surfers catch  these waves and ride the waves for hours, actually, and it was really cool. I don't surf. I  don't know how to surf. I don't think I ever will become a surfer or anything like that. But  I really like watching people surf. It's really fun to see them with their skills, doing  different tricks and things like that. So, that was really fun.  
            </p>
            <p>
            Of course, I also went in the water, and it was warm, of course. There were some  nice waves for me as well. So, that was great. And the town is pretty cute. It's a  charming town, and there are a lot of foreigners there. So, a lot of people move there  and actually buy an apartment or something like that if they really love surfing, if they  really love the ocean. So, we saw a lot of foreigners, a lot of Americans, Canadians,  probably. So, this is a great place if you want to just retire, maybe, or you just want to  find a place close to the ocean where you can surf every day, and live that type of  lifestyle… Sayulita is a good place for that.  
            </p>
            <p>
            And we ate at a great restaurant there, and it looked like they had a lot of good  food in this town. So, it's a really great place to visit, in my opinion. So, that was a cool  day trip that we did. In English, when we use the phrase “day trip,” we're referring to a  trip that you take where you only go for one day. You don't stay the night at that place.  You just go there and come back the same day. That's a day trip. So, this was great. I 
            really liked that town. And I could definitely see myself going back there again and  enjoying all the cool things there. So, I really liked that.  
            </p>
            <p>
            One last thing that I want to mention is that we went to a crocodile sanctuary.  This was a pretty unique experience. There, close to Nuevo Vallarta, there are  crocodiles, actually. And so, we went to this sanctuary where they have some of these  crocodiles, and we got to see some of the baby crocs, and that was pretty cool. It's like  looking at a very big lizard. So, I hadn't seen any baby crocodiles in person before. That  was cool. And then, there were also a couple big crocodiles and they were swimming in  the little pond underneath us. And it was a little bit scary to see them. I'm not super  scared of crocodiles, but my wife is, and so, for her, it was an interesting experience to  see these big crocodiles swimming below her. But I really enjoyed it.  
            </p>
            <p>
            And they had some other animals there, and they had other interesting birds and  other types of land animals too. But the main attraction was these crocodiles. So, that's  another thing that's pretty cool to do if you're in that area, is to go see crocodiles if this is  something that you like. So, that was another day trip that we did.  
            </p>
            <p>
            And overall, I really enjoyed my time in Nuevo Vallarta. It was a great time to  relax in the pool and allow my son to enjoy the water and to just relax and enjoy family  and enjoy some quality time there. And as I mentioned, it was also a good time for me  to play in the ocean a little bit with the big waves and enjoy the warm water there.  
            </p>
            <p>
            And I actually got to do a lot of reading as well, which I really enjoyed. I took my  Kindle with me, and I read for many hours while we were there. And it was nice to be  able to do that because I really like reading, but sometimes, it's hard to find a lot of time  to read throughout the week. So, of course, on vacation, this is the perfect time to read.  So, I really enjoyed that as well. But as I mentioned, this type of vacation isn't really my  style, so I'm probably not going to take another vacation like this for a while. But it was  really fun to do that this past week.  
            </p>
